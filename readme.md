# (Fork of) sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## This is a temporary fork. Use at your own risk.

Includes fixes for:

  - [Only handle GET requests that are not WebSocket requests](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/issues/127)
  - [sirv tests fail due to whitespace differences in terminal output on cli help test](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/issues/129)

Implemented in the pull requests:

  - [fix: only handle get requests that are not websocket requests](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/pull/128)
  - [fix: disregard whitespace in cli help text test](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/pull/130)

It is my intention to remove this fork once/if the first pull request makes it into sirv (I can live without the second one for the time being).

I’m pushing this out to npm because installing the package via git doesn’t seem to work in my npm-based project. Likely some oddness with the monorepo/pnpm setup but I don’t have time to debug/fix that now.

> An optimized middleware & CLI application for serving static files~!

  [GitHub](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv) · [Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sirv) <br>
  _The core module, returning a middleware function for use in [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) & Express-like frameworks._

* **sirv-cli**<br>
  [GitHub](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) · [Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sirv-cli) <br>
  _The standalone CLI application, allowing for instant previews of static sites._



## Benchmarks

All results are taken with the following command:

```sh
$ wrk -t8 -c100 -d10s http://localhost:$PORT/
#=> wrk -t8 -c100 -d10s http://localhost:8080
```

### Programmatic

> Running the [`/bench`](/bench) directory with Node.js v10.13.0

Compares `sirv` against `serve-static`, both of which require programmatic usage for use within existing Node servers.
